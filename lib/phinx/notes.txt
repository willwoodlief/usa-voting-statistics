Phinx environment settings hooked up to {project root}/phinx.php


October 23,2017

Updated Phix to 8.1
phinx is now part of cakephp, but I use it as a stand alone in the this project.
The new version adds more features
and the change log is at https://github.com/cakephp/phinx/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
So, I replaced the older phar with the new one in this directory.

The steps to do this is as follows (in case you want to do add it elsewhere, you can just copy the bin/phinx.phar in the project ).
Also, these steps can be repeated with future version upgrades. Just change the branch arg in the clone command below


* go outside the directories of this project and make a folder you can delete after all this
* go inside that new folder
* git clone https://github.com/cakephp/phinx.git --branch v0.9.1 (change branch in the future as appropriate)
* cd phinx
* php composer.phar install  (I have composer set up to run on the command line)
* curl -LSs https://box-project.github.io/box2/installer.php | php (the software to make this a phar)
* php box.phar build

this will make a phinx-v0.9.1.phar, rename it to phinx.phar, give it execute privledge, and move  where needed, delete temp directory
the version when run will say 0.8.1 (older one was 0.6.4)
